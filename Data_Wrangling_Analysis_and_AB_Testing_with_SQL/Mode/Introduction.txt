The following folder contains the code I wrote in the second module of 'SQL Basics For Data Sciencs Specialization'.
I would like to mention some of key concipts I have gained completing this module successfully:
1- Event tales- I knew that companies collect data about users' behavior on their sites, but I never thought of the way this data organized in database table.
  The event table has number of attributes, such as: event_name, parameter_name, parameter_value, platform..etc
    event_id                          event_time                  event_name   platform   parameter_name parameter_value

    23267713c9ea44419331731f50b6a8db	2017-06-27 10:46:39	178481	view_item	    android	  item_id	        1514
    1b7822fa7b854e01970218ae8f721fe0	2017-06-27 11:15:39	178481	view_item	    android	  item_id	        3712
    b9de71c5c3cc4cd7a97e50b832106e5a	2017-06-26 11:23:39	178481	view_item	    android	  referrer	      home
    23267713c9ea44419331731f50b6a8db	2017-06-27 10:46:39	178481	view_item	    android	  referrer	      home
    1b7822fa7b854e01970218ae8f721fe0	2017-06-27 11:15:39	178481	view_item	    android	  referrer	      home

  Creating a new table for view_item event and organizing it:
    event_id                          event_time                  platform   item_id  referrer

2- A/B testing- It's a statistics-data based method which calculates the success rate on a factor/factors 
that data scientst applied, basically it answers the question: what the users would prefer? /
which change would encourage people to pay more?
  - To calculate p-value and improvement, we have to have devide our desired population to two groups (control and treatment),
  then we need 4 inputs (sample size for each group, number of success for each group).
  Filling these values into this site ->> 'https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html' will give the answers.

3- Max function- Additional usage- as shown at the first point (view_item_event table), we were able to transform 
{item_id and referrer} to seperate columns without empty values or weird looking table thanks to MAX function.
  - For more details check the file named '1.1flexible_data_WithoutUsingMAX.sql'

4- Replacing some values with 0 or 1- Sometimes we should replace boolean values or columns which contains two 
values only. Tables that contain 0 or 1 called binary tables.
  - Binary tables are used in Machine Learning and Statistics.
